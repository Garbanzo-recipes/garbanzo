# Garbanzo

## Demo

This PWA is deployed as Github pages at:

https://garbanzo.now.sh/

## Project vision

Garbanzo aims to be a personal cookbook app that makes it easy to follow recipes, to adopt them, to store them for later use and to share them privately with others.

## Project goals

- Build a user-centric app to support the user in the key actions related to recipe handling.
- Make it easy to involve others.
- Create an app that is free and open-source.
- Help to retain the user's control over his data.

There are many recipe apps out there. But they do all have their drawbacks - some more, some less.

1. They store your recipes "somewhere in the cloud" with no easy / automatic way to get your data under control.
2. They are closed source.
3. They show you ads.
4. They are missing a holistic approach, e.g. they only let you manage recipes but do not support you in all the related tasks. I think of missing or minimalist grocery lists, small instruction texts, no variants ("How did I modify the recipe last time? It was great!") ... And in particular the social element of cooking: What about preparing a meal with a bunch of friends? What about support for that? ("I'll bring the chicken. John prepares the salad... Who was the one to bake the pie?! Has someone a pen to write it down? I liked the pie Jane made last year, but this time put much more berries in it!")
